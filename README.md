## Overview of the output

### For example the random secret number generated is 45. If the user enters 44 the output will be "too less" and if the user enters 46 the output will be "too big", in both these cases the user is lost and the game loop will continue until the user wins the game. The user wins when he enters a number that is equal to the secret number and then the game loop will break.
